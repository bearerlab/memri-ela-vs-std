# MEMRI Pre-processing and Quality Control Code

This subdirectory contains the code or links to the GitHub repos for code used for processing MEMRI images and for performing quantitative quality assurance tests. 

Please see Bearer Lab GitHub repositories for [Skull Stripping](https://github.com/bearerlab/skull-stripper), [Modal Scaling](https://github.com/bearerlab/modal-scaling), and [ROI analysis](https://github.com/bearerlab/memri-roi-measurement).

#### `slice_interpolation.m`
**Purpose:** To interpolate slices containing RF feedthrough artifacts with adjacent slice anatomy. 

**Dependencies:** None.

**Usage:** MATLAB run -- Currently only interpolates across Coronal slices.

**Inputs:** 1) Raw images; 2) Slice #'s or range of slices in need of interpolating

**Outputs:** Slice interpolated images


#### `snr_analysis.Rmd`
**Purpose:** To check whether SNR and global Mn(II) dose effects are similar between groups. 

**Dependencies:** None.

**Usage:** Knit in R.

**Inputs:** 1) Raw images; 2) Slice #'s or range of slices in need of interpolating

**Outputs:** Slice interpolated images

Note: For measurements, see [/RegionOfInterest/README.md]{/RegionOfInterest/README.md}


#### `SkullStrip.sh` & `skullstripper_v4.py`

**[See Skull Stripping Bearer Lab GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bearerlab/skull-stripper/tree/main)**

**Purpose:** To extract the brain from non-brain tissue 

**Dependencies:** FSL / NiftyReg

**Usage:** `./SkullStrip.sh <referencevolume> <referencemask> <pythonscript> <pythonversion>`

**Inputs:** 
    - Raw images with header correction, placed inside a directory called `Input`
    - Template image and mask, placed inside a directory called `Reference` 

**Outputs:** 
    - Masks (a `Masks` directory will be generated)
    - Skull Stripped Images (a `Stripped` directory will be generated)


#### `modal_scale_nii_int32.m` and others

**[See Modal Scaling Bearer Lab GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bearerlab/modal-scaling/tree/main)**

**Purpose:** To intensity normalize MEMRI images according to the modal intensity of a template.

**Dependencies:** MATLAB

**Usage:** Run in MATLAB. Use defaults for user input for _# bins_ and _delta_ values. 

**Inputs:** 
    - Skull-stripped linearly aligned images
    - Template image (single image or MDT) 

**Outputs:** 
    - Modally scaled images
    - Optional: PNGs of modally scaled histograms.


#### `average.sh`, `jaccard_similarity.sh`, `jaccard_similarity.R`, and `mutual_information.R`
**Purpose:** To quantify anatomical similarity after linear/non-linear alignments. 

**Dependencies:** FSL (for .sh scripts) and R packages listed in /requirements/requirements.md.

**Usage:** 
    1) Run in WSL terminal - `average.sh` (requires input images to be organized in subdirectories for averaging).
    2) Run in WSL terminal - `jaccard_similarity.sh` (requires hard-coded directories and file names).
    3) Run in R/RStudio - `jaccard_similarity.R` (input is the output of (2)).
    4) Run in R/RStudio - `mutual_information.R` (must be placed inside directory with warped images).

**Inputs:** Warped (non-linearly aligned) images.

**Outputs:** Images for Fig. S2I, Jaccard Indices and Normalized Mutual Information Values and Fig. S2F.


#### `roi_warped_v_smoothed.Rmd`
**Purpose:** To determine if smoothing results in a difference/loss of information from MEMRI signal intensities. 

**Dependencies:** None.

**Usage:** Knit in RStudio. 

**Inputs:** ROI summary csv generated by ROI measurement scripts (see note below).

**Outputs:** Fig. S6 graphs and statistical summaries.

Note: For ROI measurements, see [/02_roi_analysis/](../02_roi_analysis/README.md)
