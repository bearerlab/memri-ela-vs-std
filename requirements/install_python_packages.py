# This python script installs Python packages using pip. 
# Note that if using an alternative environment or intallation package other than pip,
# you will need to install the packages listed in packages_to_install on lines 33 manually.

# Current versions of MRI processing and analysis functions only require the 'pandas' package
# in addition to pre-installed modules in base Python. Later versions will be able to install
# additional packages by extending the list on line 33.
